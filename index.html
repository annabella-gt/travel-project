            <h2>Why Kraków?</h2>
            <h3>Royal Capital City of Kraków</h3>
            <p>
              Kraków, the cultural heart of Poland, the UNESCO-listed Old Town,
              where cobblestone streets lead to the magnificent Main Market
              Square. And just a short walk away, Wawel Castle stands as a
              symbol of Poland’s royal heritage, offering breathtaking views of
              the Vistula River. History lovers will also find treasures in the
              city’s museums, including the underground Rynek museum and Oskar
              Schindler’s Factory, which recounts stories of Kraków’s resilience
              and past.
            </p>
            <p>
              Beyond its historical allure, Kraków buzzes with life, blending
              old-world charm with modern energy. Explore the lively Kazimierz
              district, once the city’s Jewish quarter, now a vibrant hotspot
              for art, music, and unique eateries. With countless festivals,
              street performers, and hidden gems to discover, Kraków offers an
              unforgettable experience for every traveler, making it one of
              Europe’s most charming destinations.
